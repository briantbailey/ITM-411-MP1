#### Project Description:

The object of this project was to create an object model and do some minor data analysis 
on a set of records of Intraplate Earthquakes provided by the USGS at their website 
listed below. The data included events from the year 495 to 2003. 

For this project we needed to produce an object model with an abstract superclass 
called EarthquakeRecord and subclasses that extend that superclass for each continent 
called ContinentEarthquakeRecord. Also using an interface we needed to implement 4 
methods in the superclass for finding the oldest, newest, minimum and maximum 
earthquakes per continent.

The output for the application needs to display a few pieces of data to both the 
screen and a data file. The data that needs to be output is all the earthquake records 
in string form, the oldest and newest earthquake per continent, the minimum and 
maximum earthquakes per continent and a table of tectonic-association by continent.
